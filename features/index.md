onCourse is a highly customisable student management and marketing system. We could list its features, but let's focus instead on the results of using onCourse:

#### Reduced costs

One college went from 25 full time administrative staff to 5 within two years after implementing onCourse, while increasing their number of enrolments each year. So very many manual processes can be automated when you have a powerful website, student and tutor portals and process automation working for you.

#### Website

The best short course websites in Australia are all driven by onCourse. Best practices SEO is baked in, even if you use our default templates.


#### Marketing

Marketing is so much more than a pretty website. You need to see what courses work and what don't, and then do something about it. Send SMS and emails crafted to a student's interests and history, inviting them to re-engage with you. Offer differentiated pricing for every type of student with discounts, promotional codes, early bird discounts, gift certificates and vouchers. onCourse gives you a whole bunch of tools to target each student's individual needs.


#### Reporting

With detailed budgets and deferred income reports, you can see past the cash in your bank to understand how you really are performing.
