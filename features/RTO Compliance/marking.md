Ever wish computers could do the leg work of compliance data collection for you? Well now they can, with the addition of some 3rd party data feeds, and possibly some human button clicking.

We start by feeding in all the Qualification, Skill Set and Unit of Competency data from training.gov.au for you to use to build your courses and ensure there are no typos in reporting data or missing pieces of the course or program puzzle.

For students who have enrolled elsewhere, or are undertaking online training via an external Learning Management System (LMS), integration and data imports into onCourse on a once off or scheduled service can add to their student outcome collection. LMS tools can report back completed training and assessment outcomes which automatically updates the student results in onCourse, or trainers can update this content via their onCourse web portal.

Session by sessions attendance marking marking is also handled by the online tutor portal. With student profile images as standard, a trainer can quickly look around the room and match faces to names while marking the roll on their smart phone.

If you're dead set on using paper and pencil to record attendance marking and outcome achievement, onCourse also contains a range of print based reports for trainers, and then whole class group attendance or outcome results can be set quickly in the onCourse software by your admin staff, and variations like end date extensions or funding source changes can be adjusted at any time.
