At the end of the long hard slog of training and assessment comes graduation and certificate issuing. For some organisations where training has been a months long affair, Qualifications are lovingly printed and hand signed, ready to be issued with a handshake and a ceremony.

For RTOs delivering short courses, like First Aid certificates or RSA/RCG packages or Construction Induction training, formal certification via Statements of Attainment is no less important, but it is scaled up to be an every day event for hundreds of students.

Where ever you fit in the spectrum, Certificate issuing  is made simple in onCourse with a variety of built in print templates and transcripts you can customise for your organisation. Certificate records can be automatically generated on successful course completion and issued via email, or printed and re-printed as necessary to deliver to your students in person.

Your customised certificate templates can be uploaded as PDF documents to allow for visually unique certificates to be produced for Statements of Attainment, Qualifcations and Skill Set certificates. Automatically, transcripts accompay each certificate to include the student results for each unit.

You onCourse certificate register implements validation at each point, to confirm that the all outcomes have been marked, students have meet the completion requirements of their course and that they have supplied you with a valid USI, before a certificate can be issued.
