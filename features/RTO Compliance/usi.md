All students, all USIs, all of the time. Didn't collect the USI on enrolment? Never fear, an onCourse script is here to automatically send the student a USI completion email request with their enrolment confirmation.

Student tardy in following up the process? Daily, weekly or other time period of your choice reminders can automatically email the student the link to help them create their USI, reminding them they can't be issued with their Statement of Attainment or Qualification until they have done this.

Course finished and no USI supplied? The certificate issuing process will halt and alert you to students who need more follow up. And for the students who just can't navigate the government portal themselves, we have tools to help you create a USI on their behalf.

I freaking love ish, says Jacinda from St George and Sutherland Community College, and we know we think we know why - all this automation has suddenly made her life a whole lot easier.

Built in system verification against your AusKey will confirm in real time that all USIs supplied by students are current and correct, so you've met your requirement to not only collect, but verify, all USIs.
