What happens to a contact who visits your website who is interested in what you have to offer but isn't ready to commit to the enrolment process? By enabling waiting lists on some or all of your courses, you have a ready made way to capture a list of potential students while your enrolling others.

Best of all, when you have no classes scheduled for a course just now, maybe because it's a new program and your trying to garner interest or you run a demand driven program, there is a way for all those interested parties to sign up and say they'd love to give it a go.

Use the automated email reminders to schedule regular contact to your wait list contacts so they know you haven't forgotten about them - telling them about classes that are coming up they're on the wait list for, and perhaps even suggesting other programs that might be up their alley.

For some of your more long term or prestigious programs, enrolment by application may be just the ticket. Halfway between a wait list request and the commitment of an enrolment, you can collect information and assess a student's suitability before you offer them a position in the class or reject them as not meeting the criteria. If an applicant doesn't accept the enrolment within a designated time frame, you may choose to expire the offer and move on down the line to the next most suitable candidate.
