Build beautiful email templates and craft custom communications to your contacts. Email templates for automated communications and freehand messaging for ad-hoc correspondence is all part of onCourse as standard. In a matter of minutes, notify all students at a particular campus tonight of a special fund raising activity running this evening, or remind all your currently engaged casual tutors of an upcoming professional development opportunity. 

All messages sent from the system are logged against the contact record in an auditable trail, so you can have complete confidence in how and when your students, tutors and other contacts are receiving emails, SMS or postal mail outs. Scheduled email reminders to pay invoices, turn up to class and the electronic issuing of tax invoices and certificates of completion are all scripted ready for you to set and forget. Take our standard templates and make them as chatty or as professional sounding as suits your business.

If you love the power and reporting flexibility of expert communication tools like MailChimp, take your messaging to the next level with database level integration to multiple mailing lists. Want to subscribe every student to a mailing list automatically on enrolment? Consider it done.
