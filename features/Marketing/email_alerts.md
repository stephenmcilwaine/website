If you can imagine a rule that triggers a system based email, you can automate it. Out of the box, onCourse comes with a number of email templates and scripts ready to trigger the emails. All you need to do is decide which ones to turn on.

From reminder notifications, to marketing emails, automated certificate distribution and internal reports, automatic email alerts can be a simple or as complex as you want to make them. 

Build yourself a set of HTML templates to auto respond to common customer requests and if you want to get a little fancier than that, you can make changes to the built in scripts or add your own set of automation rules.
