For a limited time only, discount your prices and encourage those impulse sales. You offer the ultimate perishable product - once a classroom based training program takes off, just like an airplane, those unfilled seats become unsellable. Use your micro-marketing strategies to offer just in time pricing to a limited few and see whose going to fight for those deeply discounted seats.

Alternatively, use promotional codes to encourage early bird sales, with a sliding pricing scale that increases the fee automatically the closer you get to take off. You choose what sort of behaviour you want to encourage - reward, cajole or restrict enrolments based on clever pricing 'not so secret' promotional codes you hope your customers will share on social media, and buy one get one free type promotions to encourage students to bring a friend.

When it comes to promotional codes in onCourse, the sky's the limit!
