Mailing lists are built right into the onCourse software so you can allow users to self subscribe on the web, subscribe users by conducting searches of their enrolment history or auto subscribe users during certain actions, like after they enrol online.

Unsubscribe options can be embedded in the footer of your marketing emails and students can manage their subscription options through their skillsOnCourse portal.

The onCourse mailing lists can then be used to send email communications straight out of the software, or if you prefer to, integrate with specialist products like MailChimp with an API that sends all onCourse mailing list subscriptions through to your various MailChimp lists, ready for you to craft gorgeous campaigns, and monitor and track them via their advanced and specialised tool sets.
