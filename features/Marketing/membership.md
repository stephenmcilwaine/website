Memberships in onCourse are another marketing tool available to you to sell your education products in a way that works for your business model. Memberships can be sold, or given away for free, and can include special benefits like access to membership only discounts. Memberships can expire after a period of time, or offer lifelong benefits.

Want to sell your fitness classes like the gym does? Offer a six or twelve month membership option that then allows the user access to all of your healthy living classes at no additional cost.  

Corporate memberships for your loyal companies? Be sure to extend the membership benefits to their employees purchasing programs from you either via the company account our out of their own pocket. Any way you choose, onCourse can make it worthwhile for you to be a member of our club.
