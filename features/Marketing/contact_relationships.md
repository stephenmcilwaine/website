Customisable contact relationships allows you to define connections between the companies, students, tutors and other contacts in your onCourse database.

Special relationship types built into the system, such as parent and child, allow you to enable the mandatory collection of emergency contact details for minors during the online enrolment process.

Optional portal view permissions allow you to group and define contacts who can see the enrolment records of their related contacts, for example, allowing agents to view their clients records, employers to view employees or parents to log in and see the study schedule for all their children in a single view.

Powerful 'Find related' options allow you to quickly locate all related contacts for targeted marketing campaigns to your business contacts who make purchasing decisions.
