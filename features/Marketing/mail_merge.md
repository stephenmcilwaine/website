When only postal messaging will do, the onCourse messaging system will assemble a mail merge data file for you to send to your brochure distributer or embed inside your own mail addressing system.

And if you want to send a combination of messages to your customers, the clever messaging tools inside onCourse will allow you export postal details for everyone selected OR to choose just to mail to your contacts who have chosen not to supply an email address or accept email based marketing.

User controlled preferences allow your contacts to select which methods of communication are their preferred marketing channels. Marking 'return to sender' addresses as undeliverable help you avoid expensive postal bounces and encourage you to collect updated contact details the next time you engage with the contact.
