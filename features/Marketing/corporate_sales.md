Selling enrolments to corporate contacts couldn't be easier with the bulk enrolment and invoicing tools available in onCourse. 

Contact relationships can be used to quickly add employers to invoices, or employees to the enrolment so you can book a dozen employees into a few different classes all in a single transaction.

Our unique CorporatePass feature allows you to pre-issue a code to your business contacts that they can share with their employees, allowing their staff to self enrol online with the invoice requesting payment processing directly to their nominated HR contact.

Conversely, a bulk buy voucher sale allows you to offer special pre-paid places, which can be taken up as needed through the redemption of the voucher code during enrolment.
