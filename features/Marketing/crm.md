With powerful data mining capabilities, onCourse can help you create micro-marketing campaigns crafted to your needs. All potential students can be captured through wait list and mailing list sign ups, with custom tags for grouping and follow up. 

Convert those leads into sales through automated and highly directed email campaigns leading students to your integrated online ecommerce website and enticing them with promotional offers or discounts.

Find the right students in your database with flexible search options. Who works for an employer in an industry undergoing regulations change? Who lives within 15 minutes of your campus and might be willing to take up a last minute offer on a class starting tonight? And which students completed level one, but never continued on to level two? 

Craft your pricing to target each market segment to a custom price point - reward your regular students and well as encouraging your reluctant buyers.
