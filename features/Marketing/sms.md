For alerts that are sure to be read, and just in time marketing opportunities, the built in SMS messaging tools in onCourse are just the trick to get information to your communities quickly.

Scheduled and automated reminders can be set to make sure tutors know what classes they are teaching each day and students don't forget to bring vital equipment.

Custom messages sent to all the students who enrolled in a popular class last term, offering them a first chance for re-enrollment before you open the places to the public, can drive your sales strategy.
