Meet your RTO compliance requirements and offer payment flexibility for your students with your choice of payment options.

Many short course providers require payment in full for enrolments under a nominated value, however if you wish to allow zero upfront payment for online enrolments, you can simply offer a two part payment plan which requires full payment on class commencement.

For enrolments of sufficient value, a pre-defined payment plan can be put in place with regular payments scheduled for a manageable amount. Students who miss a payment will be sent an automatic reminder to pay with a link to the payment gateway where they can process their payment themselves.

Aged debtor reporting allows you to keep track of you students on payment plans and ensure they are meeting their commitments.
