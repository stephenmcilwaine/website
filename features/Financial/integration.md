onCourse exports financial data in a variety of flexible ways, allowing easy integration with financial tools such as MYOB, XERO, QuickBooks or more enterprise based SAP or custom solutions.

The general ledger at the heart of the onCourse finance system can be set up to match your chart of accounts, for the easy journaling of data between the two systems.

Line by line transactional data, or period summary data can be exported from onCourse on an automatic schedule and imported into your financial tool automatically or manually depending on your preferences.

Banking and reconciliation, summary trial balances, month end period reporting and locking makes onCourse a neat match for your favourite financial processes.
