Powerful discounting and promotional tools make the sale of every seat count. Offer early bird or last minute discounts, volume based discounts and loyalty based promotions to reward your returning customers and keep classes full. Your product is perishable, and sophisticated discounting options can be helpful to maximize your return across the whole demand curve.

Automatic time based discounts can be set to change the class fee automatically based on the days out from it's commencement. Discounts can auto commence and cease based on your pre-configured requirements. Once you've built a set of rules, it's simple to apply to all programs, or a category grouping of classes.

Reporting and discount tracking allows you to judge your successful promotional activities through the use of directed marketing campaigns with unique promotional codes.

Discounts can also be based on memberships which you can sell or give away. A membership based discount may apply to all employees of a member employer, of for the families of your own employees. 

Discounts also allow the creation of classes with multiple student fee charges, where government funding and student type dictate the one of many fee options applicable. Discounts schemes which can be created and assigned to multiple programs, with class level overrides offer the ultimate flexibility in grouping, reporting and managing all the price points you offer.
