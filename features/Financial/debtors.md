Say hello to your new automated debtor management system, and say goodbye to time wasting payment processing and identification efforts.

onCourse is your point of sale system for everything enrolment and training related. All student enrolment fees, custom training company invoices, sales of textbooks, uniforms and learning material sales, and their payments, are handled in one place.

On enrolment, invoices are generated for every purchase. Invoices can be paid for at the time of purchase, using the built in real time credit card processing gateway, deposits can be taken and pre-scheduled payment plans enacted.

Employers can book a group of their staff into a selection of training programs in a single invoice and payment process. CorporatePasses allow pre-agreed online enrolment at corporate rates, using a special code that can be distributed to staff, while centrally invoicing HR.

Overdue payment amounts for unpaid invoices, or missed payment plan payments send automatic reminders with a link to portal gateway payment tool, allowing debtors to view and print their invoice and payment history and pay by credit card.

Payment via other methods is also available, with automatic and manual banking options, and simple tools for payment reconciliation against your bank account.

Should pre-paid enrolments be canceled, a transfer wizard allows you to allocate the payment to a new enrolment for the same student, or a different attendee if needed. PCI-DSS compliant reversals back to credit cards processed through onCourse are also available, without the need to store payer credit card details in the software.
