The accrual accounting general ledger is the heart of onCourse, allowing you to manage your student fee income, funding income, liabilities and fees collected in advance of delivery. Mapping your onCourse chart of accounts to the general ledger in your accounting tool ensures a simple weekly or monthly balance transfer can take place.

A sophisticated pre-paid fee liability process ensures that at any given point in time, your income earned is representative of the training you have delivered. Invoices issued in advance of delivery are held in liability and proportionally transferred to income as the program is run.

On enrolment, invoices are created and optionally issued via email with a range of payment in advance, deposit payments, or invoice term arrangements available. Real time credit card payment processing is built into the software, with an online payment gateway built into the public website and private portal. Automated receipting, and overdue payment reminders make debt collection simple.
