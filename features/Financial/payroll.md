An important aspect of your class viability is the cost of staff, and be they employees or contractors, onCourse can record their rates of pay and using this data, not only calculate the expenses involved in delivering a single class, but also calculate the weekly, fortnightly or monthly payroll for all your trainers.

onCourse ties together your class schedules with a tutor roster and pay rates. Each tutor role can have predefined default rate, and allows fr rollover dates for pay rate changes. Payroll can be calculated per hour, per session, per student or as a fixed amount. A per enrolment bonus can be included as can additional allowances or rates for preparation or assessment marking.

Once training is delivered, onCourse handles flexible pay cycles to generate and then authorise each pay, along with custom pay lines. You can then export the final payroll data into Xero, MYOB other payroll processing system of your choice for final tax and super calculations.
