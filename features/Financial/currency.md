Built for Australian and overseas markets, onCourse allows you to select your currency of choice and build in your own tax rates, like Australia's own GST or international VAT and other sales taxes.

Sales taxes are posted to a liability account in the general ledger, ensuring that for all financial calculations only the portion of your total cost of sale that is your income, is used to calculate your program profitability. 

With full unicode character support, course descriptions, student emails and other internal text can also be written in the language of your choice.
