Detailed class budgets allow you to keep track of each program's income and expenses, giving you both forecasts and real time calculations of the break even and profitability point of your classes.

Student fee income, funding income, discounts, direct class expenses and tutor payroll combine to give you accurate predictions of your running costs, predicted and actual income.

Overview and detailed level reporting allows you to analyse on a class by class, or program grouping level the overall profitability of each activity in your organisation so you can make informed decisions when they matter the most.
