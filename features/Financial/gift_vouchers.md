Any way you want to pre-sell product without the user having to make a class selection is achievable in onCourse. Three distinct types of system gift vouchers offer the ultimate flexibility in sales and redemption.

A standard style of gift voucher where the user nominates the amount they wish to purchase and redeem the voucher for is a breeze. Other value based vouchers can also be offered for sale, either where the sale price and redemption price are identical, or where the voucher is worth more on redemption than on purchase e.g. buy a voucher for $100, redeem it for $120 worth of training.

Packaged based vouchers also allow for enormous flexibility in class sales. Nominate the courses the voucher is eligible for, and the number of enrolments the students can redeem. Using this method, you can sell a flexible bundle of classes, like ten singing lesson sessions, or four short course enrolments for an annual pass. Employers can also purchase discounted enrolments in bulk using package based vouchers, for example buying a bundle of 20 First Aid Certificate classes at 50% off, and allow their staff to redeem the vouchers around their schedules.

Vouchers automatically expire on the time period of your choosing, ensuring that financially, your potential liability doesn't sit indefinitely on the books.
