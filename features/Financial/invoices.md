All enrolments, all invoiced, all of the time. No more random mismatches between payments, invoices, debtors and credit, just one smooth process from beginning to end.

When a student is loaded into Quick Enrol, their outstanding account balance is loaded right along with them, so before you even choose their next enrolment, you can confirm if they have paid for their last one.

At the point of sale, invoices can be issued to the student directly, or to a third party, like an employer or agent. Should for any reason the students enrolment be canceled, the credit and optional payment reversal will go back to the person or company who paid for it.

Each company you invoice can have individual payment terms, and companies or individuals can have payment plan applied to their invoice.

Invoices can be paid for at time time of sale, through the real time credit card processing gateway or via any other method you allow.

Compliance with tax law ensures each item shows it's taxable amount, with a total tax summary in the invoice total.

Automated emails at the end of the enrolment process send the invoice and payment receipt to the debtor, and the enrolment confirmation to the student if they are one and the same, or different contacts. Automatic remittance instructions can be included for unpaid invoices, with a link to your online payment portal and/or EFT instructions for bank transfers.
