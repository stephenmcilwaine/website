### Student Management

Every software solution on the market does Student Management in one way or another. And some of us do it exceeding well, in a way you can highly customise to meet your own business requirements.

With the ability to create custom fields, build your own tagging structure, relationships and custom automation, onCourse provides you with the ultimate flexibility and rock solid reliability.

From initial enquiry through to enrolment, build and manage your sale process and enquiry workflow in a way that works for you. Market to your potential students and also to your alumni with sophisticated integrations with best of breed mailing list tools like MailChimp.

For Registered Training Organisations, reporting compliance is at the heart of what we offer, but we don't let it drive your business process. Enrol students in non accredited training, short courses or complete qualifications and capture the appropriate data in a unique workflow for each type of program.  


### Course and Class Templates

Quickly creating new product to offer to the market is the heart of demand driven delivery. When creating new training programs, onCourse offers you quick and convenient tools to create brand new courses from scratch, by importing data directly from training.gov.au or offering duplicate options for your existing programs.

Whether you're creating a new class for a course, upgrading a qualification to a new training package version or rolling over your three hundred classes from last term's program ready to offer to a new enrolment intake, onCourse is on the job.

### Resource Management

To effectively manage your training programs, you need an understanding of your resource allocation and their associated business expenses. Room and tutor allocations are checked for collision on allocation, and expenses for your resources populate into the class budget, to keep you informed at all times of your running costs, suck costs, and necessary enrolments for both break even and profit.

Detailed timetabled views for tutors and rooms, plus unavailability management when external events take your resources out of the picture, allow for effective reporting and resource allocation management across your campuses.

### Staff Management

Many training organisations maintain a large stable of subject matter experts available as contractors or casual employees. Your onCourse staff management tools allow you to store employment documentation and certification securely against each tutor record, publish a biography out to the web, and give every staff member, no matter how many there might be, access to a tutor portal with all their past, present and future scheduled program details.

With an easily searchable employment history and availability matrix, it's simple to locate the right employee for a job. You can allocate them them to a schedule, manage the confirmation process, and record their pay rates, time and attendance for payroll processing.

### Tutor Payroll

onCourse includes a complete time and attendance time sheet system for your teaching staff, that allows on the go adjustments to pay rates and scheduling for the most complicated of arrangements.

Multiple tutors at multiple rates can be scheduled to deliver each session, with assessors and coordinators allocated their pay rates on the basis of enrolment numbers rather than delivery hours.

At the end of each pay cycle, an automated CSV export into your payroll system of choice will export all the data required ready for you to process the payments.

### Document Management

Amazon cloud hosted version and access controlled document management is included as standard with all onCourse managed solutions. Permission based access allows you to automatically control distribution of resources to your tutors and students via their portal, or to your onCourse website as part of your marketing copy.

Need to upload a resource to all classes from a course? Simple. Photo Id for every student? Consider it done. Marketing images for every course on your onCourse website? We have the tool for that.

With a rich tagging and document allocation engine managing your training and assessment content in the heart of your student management system, putting your fingers on evidence for audit compliance becomes a breeze.

Automatic uploads to the document management system of records like student certifications issued also provide your students with the ability to log in, download and print resources and certificates they've misplaced without having to contact your office staff.

### Version Control

A delete option is handy, but often is works against the evidence you need to retain to show the process of events that led to a certain decision being made. In onCourse, immutable records that can be reversed but not deleted ensure that you'll never lose track of enrolment history, invoicing or payment data due to data entry mistakes.

All documents uploaded to onCourse are also automatically under version control too, with the ability to lock records to versions to shown a tidy history of which class group was provided with each version of your continually evolving training and assessment resources.

### Integration

The powerful onCourse API that drives the automation and reporting options also allows for simple integration with external software solutions.
